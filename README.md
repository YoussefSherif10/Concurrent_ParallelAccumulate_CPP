# Concurrent_ParallelAccumulate_CPP

This is a function that calculates the sum of numbers in a given range with an initial value.
The number of threads is calculated in the runtime. I used templated types and Iterators. the threads are managed by a vector and the result of each thread is assigned into a vector to hold results.
